#### onos-apps

During the time of researching in SDN, it's oblivious to use SDN controller and switch. My research mainly focus on ONOS 1.11 
and POFswitch or OVS-POF, both of which are modified to support POF protocol. I change the OVS, which is based on OVS 2.5, to 
support POF. Then, it should take more tests to monitor the OVS-POF function. 

There are no mistakes between pox and OVS-POF for now. The next work I will do is to test the inter-communicate between ONOS 
and OVS-POF. This repository will store my created apps. Note that, those apps may not just all act as test apps.

The other apps I have ever committed can be found also in my git:
